They were made from 1898 to WW2 (some sources state 1897 to 1943) and chambered for a wide variety of calibers during its long production run. The New Service was a large, heavy, double action, swing out cylinder revolver and most were manufactured with barrel lengths from 4” to 7.5” with fixed sights. The New Service Target and Shooting Master came with adjustable sights and were some of the finest target guns of their day. The New Service was different from its immediate, double action predecessors in that the cylinder turned clockwise, which was the opposite of the .38” caliber New Army, Navy and Marine. As stated by James E. Serven in Colt Firearms 1836-1960, Colt chose this method because “in anticlockwise rotation, the pressure of the hand against the cylinder tended to push crane away from the frame” which Colt considered “undesirable”. In theory, it may be true but I have often wondered if this was just another way for Colt to differentiate its products from its main competitor, Smith & Wesson. I’ve owned several Smith & Wesson revolvers over the years and they have all been very accurate if they were fed good quality ammunition, which in my case is mostly handloads. Still, it was a point that Colt chose to single out and I’m sure it helped them sell a lot of revolvers.</p>

                    <h3 class="left-text heading">2. Merkel Model 8</h3>
                    <img class="right-float" src="http://www.allaboutguns.net/Merkel-Model-8_files/Merkel-Model-%208.jpg" /><p class="normal-font centre-text">Merkel shotguns, although well known and highly prized throughout the world, have been rather uncommon in the United States until recently. The Merkel Model 8 side by side shotgun was imported for a very short time by GSI Inc. and looks basically like a Model 47E without ejectors. According to a 1992 GSI pamphlet I have, both guns use Anson & Deeley boxlock actions and the Model 8 came with either single or double triggers, case hardened receiver, straight English style stock or pistol grip, solid rib and demibloc barrels. The barrels have two locking lugs, held fast by a sliding bolt in the action, along with a Greener crossbolt for extra reinforcement making for a good, strong design. This particular Model 8 is a 12 gauge but the same pamphlet shows that it was also offered in 16 and 20 gauges. The stock does not have the typical, Germanic style cheekpiece so prevalent on German and Central European guns and I must admit that when I first saw it, I was somewhat surprised it didn’t have one. Which is not a bad thing as I never got used to seeing them on shotguns, not to mention that being an American I am conditioned to accept them as strictly for use on rifles. The engraving on the Model 8 is minimal, which suits the utilitarian nature of the gun and is unlike the heavy, Germanic relief hunting scene usually found on higher grade German guns. The receiver has a set of cocking indicators on either side that provide both a visual and tactile method of checking the readiness of the gun and the forend has a Deeley & Edge style latch to fasten it to the barrels. The workmanship overall is very good for a gun in this price range. My first exposure to the Model 8 was when I had a chance to try one on some clay birds. I managed to absolutely pulverize the targets and after the first ten shots were fired with nary a miss, I decided I had to buy one and I haven’t regretted it since. The gun fits me very well indeed and is a joy to handle.</p>
